# Skin Disease Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on classifying skin diseases using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project is divided into several Jupyter notebooks and a Python script, each serving a specific purpose in the workflow.

## Repository Structure

- `DataInputPipeline.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing and pipeline creation.
- `Image_Generation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for generating and augmenting images for training the model.
- `InferenceCode_SkinClassification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for running inference on the trained skin disease classification model.
- `PretikaConvert_tflite.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for converting the trained model to TensorFlow Lite format.
- `formapi.py`: Python script for integrating form APIs.
- `imageToExcel.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for converting images to Excel format.
